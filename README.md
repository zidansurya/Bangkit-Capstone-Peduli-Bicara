## Peduli Bicara (C22-PS108) - Bangkit 2022 Capstone Project
Glad to see you here! This repo contain the machine learning for our project named "Peduli Bicara" as an educational app for Indonesia children's speech delay problem. 

## What is Peduli Bicara?
Speech delay is a general term referring to the process of speech and language delays that are not following the child's developmental age. Lack of understanding and serious attention from parents regarding the condition of speech delay in children can interfere with the child's growth and development process at a later stage. Parents need to detect it as early as possible from 12-13 months. One of the causes of speech delay is the lack of interaction with parents which is very influential in their speaking ability. 

Todayâ€™s technology is developing so fast and problems can be solved in modern and varied ways. Some of them use AI technology that allows machines to learn a pattern and predict, cloud computing allows us to use resources from the cloud database, and mobile applications with easy access because almost everyone has a smartphone. How can these technologies help solve the problem of speech delay in children?

Peduli Bicara is an android application to help prevent speech delay and help the children's development. This application comes up with features to know the children's word mention, help them to learn new words, and give a new way for parents to interact with their children.
 
Machine Learning:  
The machine learning tasks are to make an English speech recognition. The tasks from machine learning are:  
Researching and collecting datasets for machine learning training and do the preprocessing for the dataset (Week 1)  
Training using the CNN and testing dataset (Week 1 & Week 2)  
Testing end developing to enhance the model (Week 2 &  Week 3)  
Fixing the bug and problem and enhance the model (Week 3 & Week 4)  
Increasing the accuracy of the training and converting to the .pb file so it can be deployed on the VM (Week 5)
